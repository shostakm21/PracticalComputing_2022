###BLOCKQUOTES
_The Way We Were_by G.A. Parker

> A sweet and friendly porcupine, \
> Snuffled up; his eyes met mine. \
> I picked him in bright red wine, \
> And labelled each and every spine.

> A thousand mroe I then did nail, \
> and measured all from head to tail, \
> and plotted on a log/log scale.
